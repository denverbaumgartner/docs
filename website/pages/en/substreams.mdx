![Substreams Logo](/img/substreams-logo.png)

Substreams is a powerful blockchain indexing technology developed to improve The Graph Network:
- Substreams allows you to speed up the indexing times of your subgraph.
- Substreams allows you to index non-EVM data (Solana, Injective, Starknet, Vara...)

This is possible because your subgraph can use a Substreams package as a data source, thus creating a Substreams-powered Subgraph (SpS).
A Substreams package a binary file that contains all the definitions of the data that you want to extract from the blockchain (similar to the `mapping.ts` file of your subgraph).

The following example shows a subgraph manifest (`subgraph.yaml`) that uses a Substreams package as data source, thus receiving the data extracted by the Substreams.
Then, you can use this data in your `mapping.ts` and perform all the transformations needed as a usual subgraph.

// example

## Find Substreams packages

There are many Substreams packages already built that you can simply import into your subgraph.
[substreams.dev](https://substreams.dev) is a Substreams registry where you can explore different Substreams packages for several blockchain networks.

## Create Your Own Substreams Package

If you can't find a Substreams package that fits your needs, you can create your own package.
Creating a Substreams involves a Rust function that selects which specific data you want to extract from the network.

However, the Substreams CLI allows you to auto-generate a Substreams project without writing any code.
You can import Solana transactions or Vara extrinsics in your subgraph by using the auto-generation tools provided by The Graph.

In the folllowing example, you run the `substreams init` command (similar to the `graph init` command), where you can select which kind of project you want to initialize.
You can choose among a variety of project generations (Solana transactions, EVM events and calls, Starknet transactions...).

From the generated project, you can run `substreams codegen subgraph` to convert the Substreams project into a ready-to-deploy subgraph project!
