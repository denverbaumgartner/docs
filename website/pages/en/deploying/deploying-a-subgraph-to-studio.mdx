title: Deploying a Subgraph to Subgraph Studio
---

> Before deploying, you must install The Graph CLI; please review [Creating a Subgraph]()

When you deploy a subgraph, you push it to Subgraph Studio, where you'll be able to stage it. It's important to remember that deploying is not the same as publishing. When you publish a subgraph, you are publishing it on-chain.

## What can you do in Subgraph Studio?

[Subgraph Studio]() allows you to do the following:

- Create and manage your API keys for specific subgraphs
- Create your Subgraph in Subgraph Studio
- Authenticate your account from the CLI
- Deploy a Subgraph to Subgraph Studio
- Stage it in the playground environment
- Integrate it in staging using the query URL

In Subgraph Studio, you can view the following:

- Your user account controls
- A list of subgraphs you've created
- A section to manage your API keys
- A section to manage, view details, and visualize the status of a specific subgraph
- A section to manage your billing

Step-by-Step

## Install the Graph CLI

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and a package manager of your choice (`npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm`) installed to use the Graph CLI. Check for the [most recent](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-tooling/releases?q=%40graphprotocol%2Fgraph-cli&expanded=true) CLI version.

**Install with yarn:**

```bash
yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

**Install with npm:**

```bash
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

## Create your Subgraph in Subgraph Studio

### Create an account

Before deploying your subgraph you need to create a subgraph in [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).

1. Open [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).
2. Connect your wallet.
   - You can do this via MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, or Safe.
3. After you connect your wallet, your unique deploy key will be displayed on your "My Subgraphs" page or your “subgraph details” page in the Studio.
   - The deploy key allows you to publish your subgraphs or manage your API keys and billing. It is unique but can be regenerated if you think it has been compromised.
4. You can create one or multiple API keys by clicking the API keys tab at the top of your homepage. See image below:
   - You can limit API keys to a specific domain in the security section.

> Important: You need API keys to query subgraphs

#### Subgraph Compatibility with The Graph Network

In order to be supported by Indexers on The Graph Network, subgraphs must:

- Index a [supported network](/developing/supported-networks)
- Must not use any of the following features:
  - ipfs.cat & ipfs.map
  - Non-fatal errors
  - Grafting

## Initialize your Subgraph

Once your subgraph has been created in Subgraph Studio you can initialize the subgraph code using this command:

```bash
graph init --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

You can view the `<SUBGRAPH_SLUG>` value on your subgraph details page in Subgraph Studio, see image below:

![Subgraph Studio - Slug](/img/doc-subgraph-slug.png)

After running `graph init`, you will be asked to input the contract address, network, and ABI that you want to query.

- This will generate a new folder on your local machine with some basic code to start working on your subgraph. You can then finalize your subgraph to make sure it works as expected.

## Graph Auth

Before can deploy your subgraph to Subgraph Studio, you must login into your account using the CLI. To do this, you will need your deploy key (you can find it on your "My Subgraphs" page or under your subgraph details page).

Then, use the following command to authenticate from the CLI:

```bash
graph auth --studio <DEPLOY KEY>
```

## Deploying a Subgraph to Subgraph Studio

Once you are ready, you can deploy your subgraph to Subgraph Studio.

> Deploying a subgraph with the CLI pushes it to the Studio, where you can test it and and update the metadata. This action won't publish your subgraph to the decentralized network.

Use the following CLI command to deploy your subgraph:

```bash
graph deploy --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

After running this command, the CLI will ask for a version label.

- It's strongly recommended to use [semver](https://semver.org/) for versioning like `0.0.1`. That said, you are free to choose any string as version such as:`v1`, `version1`, `asdf`.
- The labels you create will be visible in Graph Explorer and can be used by curators to decide if they want to signal on a specific version or not, so choose them wisely.

## Testing your Subgraph

After deploying, you can test/stage your subgraph in Subgraph Studio, deploy another version, update the metadata, and publish to Graph Explorer when you are ready.

Use Subgraph Studio’s playground to:

- Check your subgraph logs
- The subgraph logs will indicate if and where a subgraph fails.

## Publish your Subgraph in Subgraph Studio

You are now ready to publish your subgraph!

In order to publish your subgraph successfully, review [publishing a subgraph] (/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/).
